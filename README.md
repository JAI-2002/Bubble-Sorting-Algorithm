# Bubble-Sorting-Algorithm
Simple Bubble Sorting Algorithm 
Easily understandable bubble sort algorithm in python
Enter the list values as per your wish, (unsorted)
The Whole Algorithm uses double for loop and its starts the scan from the list element in 0th index till last
Scans from left to right
Once the Scan is Completed - 
Then the first element is compared to the next element: 
        if the nxt element is small then swapping takes place
        if the nxt element is large then swapping does not take place
